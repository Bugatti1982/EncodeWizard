<p>Encoding audio is a simple process in which you determine the right quality while</p>
<p>making it compatable with most players. Now of course not all players honor the</p>
<p>5.1 soundtrack that is in most players. There are two options for making it still</p>
<p>playable across all players. One option is to set the bitrate to whatever one you want.</p>
<p>If you are going to use this option, most likely you want to use the 384 option. The</p>
<p>second option is to use the quality setting instead which is probably the most preferred.</p>
<p>Why you probably want to use the <b>quality</b> option compared to the <b>bitrate</b> is</p>
<p>because the <b>quality</b> option is much more flexable and is more closer to the original</p>
<p>source. The <b>bitrate</b> option often can be let down in loud instances or very quiet instances</p>
<p>or could have sounds that sound "watery" or not as clear. When using the <b>quality</b> setting,</p>
<p>it is prefered that you set it to 5 for AC-3 5.1 tracks or AC-3 7.1 tracks as a source. For DTS</p>
<p>5.1 or AC-3 2.0 tracks, use 2.</p>
