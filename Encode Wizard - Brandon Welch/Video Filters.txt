<p>Video filters are extremely important in enhancing the look of the video while also</p>
<p>providing more efficient avenues for compressing video. If you are encoding Blu-rays</p>
<p>that have a ton of grain, video filters are the best way to compress the file size.</p>
<p>The first thing to know about video filters is that there are two settings called</p>
<p><b>Detelecine</b> and <b>Deinterlace</b>. These are used primarly for encoding DVD's.</p>
<p>When you observe old DVD's, often times there are random lines that appear when movement</p>
<p>occurs in the footage.</p>

<p>How to resolve this is to use the deinterlace and detelecine options.</p>
<p>Deinterlace gives you lots of options that you can use to your advantage. However if you</p>
<p>want to totally eliminate these lines, you may need to set it to <b>Decomb</b> and set</p>
<p>it at it's highest detection speed. If that still doesn't do the trick, you can try also</p>
<p>using <b>Detelecine</b> to remove any artifacts that might be still present. Keep in mind</p>
<p>that you can use multiple settings at once if it doesn't do the job well.</p>

<p>The <b>Denoise</b> option is most important in Blu-ray encoding since it is presented in high</p>
<p>definition and most old movies are prone to grain or noise. Denoise helps with removing the</p>
<p>grain for a cleaner presentation. There are two options you can choose from for denoising videos.</p>
<p>There is <b>hqdn3d</b> and <b>NL Means</b>. If you have the time it is prefered that you use NL</p>
<p>Means since that eliminates the grain considerably well. But if you want a faster way you may use</p>
<p>hqdn3d. If NL Means does not provide you with the desirable space, there is a third option you can try</p>
<p>that is located in the <b>Video</b> page. Under the <b>Optimise Video</b> section there is a tab called</p>
<p><b>Tune</b>. Select the <b>Animation</b> option to fully eliminate any extra grain that is not desired.</p>
<p>(Make sure that for both NL Means and hqdn3d you set them both to <b>Strong</b>). With DVD's, you don't</p>
<p>need to use the denoise option since they are lower in resolution.</p>
