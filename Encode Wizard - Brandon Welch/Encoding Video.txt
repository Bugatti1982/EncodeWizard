<p>To learn video encoding you must be aware of all the functions</p>
<p>To start loading a video you click on the <b>Source</b> button and direct where your video file is.</p>
<p>Once you have loaded your video start to think about how much of the video you want to compress.</p>
<p>It's good idea to to have the file be at the very least half the size of the original source.</p>
<p>(Note: If your loading a video that is straight from a Blu-ray, you need to look at other sources</p>
<p>such as ITunes and look under the file size for 1080p resolution) <b>Disclaimer: this website</b></p>

<p>Next consider how to get the best quality with the lowest file size possible. You can choose from</p>
<p>either <b>Constant Quality</b> or <b>Average Bitrate</b>. Constant quality is the most prefered and distibutes</p>
<p>the proper bitrate necessary. The setting that is best is setting the quality to either 23 or 24.</p>
<p>Average Bitrate allows you to set the average bitrate yourself. The two best ways to use this is if</p>
<p>you are in a situation where you want to reduce the file size from a Blu-ray that is hard to compress</p>
<p>or if you want to upscale DVD's. To calculate this you need to do some research first before you calculate </p>
<p>the bitrate. In this example, you see that there is DVD of Spider-Man 2 and I want to upscale it to the</p>
<p>same file size as it is on ITunes.</p>

<p>Now that you know that the file size you want is 2.05 GB as the file size, the next step is to look up</p>
<p>the number of minutes the movie is. You can do it by doing one of two things. You can calculate it by</p>
<p>using a calculator or look it up by using sites like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> or</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blu-ray.com/">Blu-ray.com</a></p>

<p>The final bit of research you need is the average bitrate for the audio. If you've already converted the</p>
<p>video with the same settings that is recommended for audio, just right click on the previously converted</p>
<p>video and click <b>Properties</b> and click on the <b>Details</b> tab. If you don't have the video, just use 384 as</p>
<p>the average bitrate for the audio</p>

<p>Now that you have all the information you need, the final step is to plug in all the information using this</p>
<p>equation: <b>((Desired file size / (Number of minutes * 0.0075)) * 1000) - Audio bitrate.</b> When you plug in the</p>
<p>numbers you should get something like this: <b>(2.05 / (127 * 0.0075)) * 1000 = 2152 (Estimated) - 384 = 1768.</b></p>
<p>When you use the 2-Pass Method, make sure that you check both 2-Pass Encoding, Turbo 1st Pass, set the Encoder Preset</p>
<p>to Fast and select Varible Framerate. If you are using a DVD as a source, you may want to set the Framerate to 23.976</p>
<p>and select Constant Framerate to keep it compatible with most players. Here is a comparison...</p>
